        <h3><u>Title:To Kill a Mockingbird</u></h3>
        <h3><u>
            Author: Harper Lee  
        </u></h3>
        Set in the 1930s, this Pulitzer Prize-winning novel follows Scout Finch, a <b><i>young</i></b> girl growing up in the <b><i>racially</i></b> segregated town of Maycomb, Alabama. 
        Her father, Atticus Finch, is a lawyer who defends a <b><i>Black</i></b> man falsely accused of raping a white woman. 
        Through Scout's eyes, the book explores themes of racism, morality, and justice. To Kill a Mockingbird remains a <b><i>powerful</i></b> commentary on prejudice and human empathy.
